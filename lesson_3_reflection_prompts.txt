When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are working on a group project where other contributors are working on the same project.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might want to pull when a major change happens in your code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a repository on your repository.  A clone is a copy on your local hard drive.
    You'd use a fork when you want the ability to share with others.  Also it allows a mechanism to send feedback
    to the originator.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you can refer back to that state prior to other contributors making changes online.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Maybe using a slack channel.  It would be easier instead of ease of communication, 
    but harder in terms of record keeping as well as mis-communication. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you would like to try out something experimentally and not want to place in production yet!
